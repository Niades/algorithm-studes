Task Definition
==================
Given two integer arrays to represent weights and profits of ‘N’ items, we need to find a subset of these items which will give us maximum profit such that their cumulative weight is not more than a given number ‘C’. Write a function that returns the maximum profit. Each item can only be selected once, which means either we put an item in the knapsack or skip it.
